# E-Shop Project

## üìú Project Overview

This is an **e-commerce** web application built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The project showcases a fully functional online store, including essential features like product display, user authentication, and a shopping cart. This project allowed me to practice and implement key concepts of full-stack web development using React and other technologies in the MERN stack.

## üé• Learning & Inspiration

To develop this project, I completed an **11-hour React course** on YouTube:
- [React Course - Full Tutorial for Beginners (by freeCodeCamp.org)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8)

Additionally, I primarily followed this tutorial as a guide to building the e-commerce functionality:
- [MERN E-Commerce Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=YuqOXByJfY1U19do&v=O3BUHwfHf84&feature=youtu.be)

While following these tutorials, I made several changes, additions, and personal modifications to experiment with and deepen my understanding of the MERN stack and React.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend framework for building the user interface
- **Express.js**: Backend framework for handling server-side logic
- **Node.js**: Server environment for running JavaScript on the backend
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing product, user, and order data
- **CSS**: Styling and layout

## üöÄ Features

- **User Authentication**: Register and log in to manage your account.
- **Product Display**: Browse available products, view product details.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add products to a shopping cart, modify quantities, and proceed to checkout.
- **Order Management**: Place orders and view order history.
  
## üîÑ Modifications and Additions

Throughout the project, I experimented with additional features and changes to the original tutorial content. Some of these include:

## üì¶ Installation and Setup

To get this project up and running locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd e-shop-project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** for both the frontend and backend:
   ```bash
   npm install
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   - In one terminal window, run the backend server:
     ```bash
     npm run server
     ```
   - In a separate terminal window, start the React frontend:
     ```bash
     cd client
     npm start
     ```

4. **Visit** `http://localhost:3000` to view the application in your browser.
